Okay, I understand. You're reviewing the Microtheories within OpenCyc, and your role is to provide concise and accurate descriptions. 

Here's a description of the microtheory `GeneraLLexiconMt`:

**GeneraLLexiconMt** is a microtheory designed to represent and reason about the general vocabulary of a language. It focuses on defining words, their properties (like part-of-speech), and their relationships to other words. It aims to provide a foundational lexicon that can be used as a basis for more specialized microtheories and reasoning tasks. Essentially, it's a core component for handling word-level information within the OpenCyc knowledge base.
