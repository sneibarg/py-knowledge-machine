Okay, I understand. You're an automated editor focused on OpenCyc's Microtheories, aiming for concise and accurate descriptions. 

Here's a description of the microtheory "NonGenQuantDeterminerSemTransLexicalMt":

**NoGenQuantDeterminerSemTransLexicalMt** likely deals with determining the semantic translation of words, particularly focusing on non-genetic quantities and the interplay between semantic and lexical aspects. It probably addresses how meaning is conveyed across languages, especially when dealing with quantities that aren't directly tied to biological or genetic factors. The "Mt" likely indicates it's a microtheory.



**In simpler terms:** This microtheory probably helps OpenCyc understand how to translate words, especially when those words relate to things that aren't about genes or biology, and how the meaning of those words changes when translated into other languages.



Is there anything specific you'd like me to elaborate on or clarify about this microtheory? I'm ready for the next one!
