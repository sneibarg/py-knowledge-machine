Okay, I understand. You're reviewing the OpenCyc microtheories, and I'm to provide a concise and accurate description based on the given name.

Here's a description of the microtheory "HorusLocusPlusOntologyMappingMt":

**HorusLocusPlusOntologyMappingMt** likely refers to a microtheory focused on mapping the spatial relationships and locations (loci) associated with the mythological figure Horus, integrating this with a broader ontology (a structured representation of knowledge).  The "Mt" likely indicates it's a more advanced or "master" version of a previous mapping.

**In simpler terms:** This microtheory aims to define and connect the places, locations, and spatial aspects of Horus's mythology to a larger, organized knowledge system. It's about understanding *where* Horus is associated with things, and how that relates to other concepts in a structured way.
