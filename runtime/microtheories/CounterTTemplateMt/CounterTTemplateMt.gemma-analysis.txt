Okay, I understand. You're reviewing Microtheories within the OpenCyc platform and I'm to provide a concise and accurate description based on the given name.

Here's a description of the Microtheory "CounterTTemplateMt":

**CounterTTemplateMt:** This microtheory likely deals with the concept of *counter-examples* or *refutations* of templates or general rules. It probably focuses on identifying instances that violate or contradict a given template, allowing for reasoning about exceptions and limitations to those templates. The "TT" likely refers to "Template" and "Mt" possibly indicating a method or mechanism for handling these counter-examples.  It's designed to enable reasoning about situations where a general rule doesn't apply.
